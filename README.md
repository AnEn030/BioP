# Open-source 3D Bioprinter

This project arises from my doctoral thesis from the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and is aimed to continues it.

My Thesis titeled "Development of an open-source bio-printer with multiple print-heads" will be published as soon as approved.

Currently, this repository only provides the Marlin configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h files of the open source 3D Bioprinter.

After finalizing the thesis all files necessary for the construciton will be published.
